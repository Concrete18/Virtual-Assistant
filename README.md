# Virtual Assistant

This is my virtual text-based assistant. I made it in order to bypass the need for an interface for many smaller
functions.

## Techniques Used

* Natural Language processing
* NLTK via LancasterStemmer, tokenization and stopwords was used as a base for my custom list
* Multiple APIs for Home Automation

## TO DO
